<span style="font-size: 12pt;">As we live in a globalized world, every time more people are traveling abroad to work and/or study. And that’s exactly why among the many protection plans we offer, student travel insurance is included.</span>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Young people travel abroad for different reasons and studying is one of them,<strong> this created the need of designing specific travel insurance for students</strong>. The good news is that <strong>all the companies we work with offer these policies</strong>, so you’ll have many options to choose from. </span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Why it is important to purchase travel insurance?</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">First, it’s important for you to understand that<strong> the purchase of an insurance policy</strong>&nbsp;doesn’t imply that you’re waiting for bad things to happen, it’s actually the whole opposite: <strong>you’re preventing bad things from happening. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Let’s put it this way: you’re studying in a country that’s very far from yours and as you’ve been so busy with your academic schedule, your health collapses and you're in need of seeing a doctor. Of course, you don’t know where to go and neither have enough money to pay for medical attention.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Without<strong> student travel insurance</strong> you’ll have to take out of your pocket money that perhaps you had intended for other expenses, or -even worse- you wouldn’t be able to go see a doctor at all, damaging your health a lot more! </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Now, <strong>if before going abroad, you hired an insurance policy, then you’ll have nothing to worry about</strong>, because with just a phone call, an expert will assist you in everything you need and you won’t even have to expend a dime, which is great!&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">&nbsp;What are the included coverages?</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Hiring this service <strong>will allow you to count with medical assistance</strong>, medication and hospitalization expenses, urgent message relay, repatriation; 24 hours travel assistance line, <strong>compensation for lost baggage</strong>, etc.</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">And this is exactly why we invite you to wait no longer and buy on our web page the student travel insurance you need!&nbsp;</span></h2>
