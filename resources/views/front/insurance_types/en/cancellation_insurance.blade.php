<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Note that<strong> this insurance will be your safe passage in case you don’t get to make your trip</strong>, which is actually a really good option to don’t lose your money. </span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">What are the coverages of this plan?</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>The full coverage of your insurance will always depend on which company provides it</strong>, but in general, <strong>this policy will have you covered</strong> if the airline cancels the flight with no previous notice or if you’re unable to make the trip for major causes. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Among the <strong>major causes accepted to make use of the cancellation coverage</strong> we can name: </span></p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Hospitalization or death of a family member. &nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Unforeseen natural disasters at home or at the destination place. </span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Sudden illness or injury that inhibits you from travelling, by order of a licensed specialist. </span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Legal obligation, like being called for jury duty or to appear as a witness in court. &nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Among others. </span></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">If any of the things listed above happen to you, <strong>you’ll get a full refund of the expenses you made</strong> buying flight tickets and reserving your hotel room. </span></p>
