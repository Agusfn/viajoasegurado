<span style="font-size: 12pt;">You know, more than anybody, how important your personal belongings are, so when traveling abroad don‘t risk them and before getting on the plane, purchase your international belongings and IT insurance with us.</span>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">This policy can only be purchased separately. This means that<strong>&nbsp;regular insurance plans won’t have this coverage, unless you ask your travel advisor to include it</strong>, something we highly recommend.</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">How important it is to purchase this policy?</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>To have this insurance is almost as important as it is to have health travel insurance</strong>; because we know for sure that you don’t want to lose any of your important <strong>belongings or technological items</strong>. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Note that during a trip away from home anything can happen.
